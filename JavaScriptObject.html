        <h1>JavaScript Objects</h1>

        <h2>Create your own Character!</h2>

        <p>A JavaScript object is like a giant variable that is able to contain multiple properties with different values.</p>

        <p>One example of this is a home. If I were to describe to someone the different aspects of different homes, I would list out different properties.</p>

        <p>First, we'll need to know what type of home it is (if it's an apartment or a house).<br> Then we may want to know how many bedrooms are in the home.<br> If we want to travel to this home, we will need to know its address.<br> And if we wish to purchase this home, we need to know how much it costs.</p>
