        <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        
        <h2>Loops</h2>
        
        <div id = "loopDiv"></div>
        
        <button class="button"  onclick='loopFunction()'>Try It</button>
        
        <h2>Conditional Statements</h2>
        <p>This will use a simple if/then statement. If the time is less than 20:00, then clicking the button will present text saying "Hello!" Otherwise, it will say "Goodbye!"</p>
        <button type="button" onclick=conditionFunction()>Try It</button>
        
        <p id= "displayTime"></p>
        
        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <p>Functions are used to perform various tasks in JavaScript. Many examples are in this site, which include these links:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="DOMManip.html">DOM Manipulation</a></li>
            <li><a href="JavaScriptEvent.html">JavaScript Events</a></li>
            <li><a href="LocalStorage.html">Local Storage</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Parameters</h2>
        <p>Parameters are variables within the paranthesis of a JavaScript function. Placing a variable in these parenthesis is essentially the same as declaring a new variable.</p>
        
        <h2>Arrays</h2>
            <p>An array is a list of multiple items contained within a single variable. An example of an Array can be found here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="JSON.html">JSON</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Associative Arrays</h2>
        <p>An associative array in JavaScript is one with numbered indexes. It will use 1 variable name, but different numbers to distinguish between different values. For example, the associate array name can be var animal, and then the list will go by numbers in brackets.<br>
        So we can have an associate array list look like this:<br>
        animal[0] = "pigeon"<br>
        animal[1] = "Turkey"<br>
        animal[2] = "Chicken"</p>
        
        <h2>JavaScript Objects</h2>

        <p>A JavaScript object is like a giant variable that is able to contain multiple properties with different values.</p>

        <p>One example of this is a home. If I were to describe to someone the different aspects of different homes, I would list out different properties.</p>

        <p>First, we'll need to know what type of home it is (if it's an apartment or a house).<br> Then we may want to know how many bedrooms are in the home.<br> If we want to travel to this home, we will need to know its address.<br> And if we wish to purchase this home, we need to know how much it costs.</p>
